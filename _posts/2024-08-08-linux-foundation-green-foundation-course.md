As Software Engineers learning about the energy expenditure and how we are impacting the world and how we can be more energy efficient is very important. This short free course [Green Software for Practitioners (LFC131)]{:target="_blank"} from Linux Foundation is very interesting with explainable images and quizes. Recommend all to enroll and read it. It was a fun and practical learning experience. My certificate can be found [here](../assets/post_images/2024-08-08/green-software-for-practitioners.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
