There have many tools in the market for UI development predominantly: Android Studio for Android using Kotlin and XCode for iOS using Swift. To add to the toollist, there are also hybrid tools which allow to develop and then compile to both Android and iOS like Flutter, React Native etc.

Recently, the Kotlin Team [announced the development of Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile toolkit](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2022/10/kmm-beta/){:target="_blank"} to develop a single code base using Kotlin and build apps for both Android and iOS. This is an awesome news for the Kotlin language fan base who are currently developing Android mobile applications with the capability to build iOS applications too without the need to maintain another code base in another language enabling reusability.

[As of March 21st, 2023](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform-mobile-getting-started.html){:target="_blank"} it's in beta but many have given it a try and have shared their experience. Hope you try it. Feel free to share your experiences in the comments section below :)
