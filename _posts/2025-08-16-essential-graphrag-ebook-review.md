I am very passionate about GenAI and it's value with assistance in the natural language and other modalities. This free ebook made available courtesy of Manning and Neo4j was a true delight to read. It's fun, very helpful in terms of the patterns to bring more groundedness and context to your search and relevancy using graph knowledge and data into context. The whole world is connected and everything in it and through understanding it we derive more meaningful insights of it. The book contains practical coding exercises and the pictures are as always a delight to understand the concepts. Would recommend it to everyone if you are into graphs, knowledge and deriving insights or just want to play with something out. This book is freely available in pdf format. :)
