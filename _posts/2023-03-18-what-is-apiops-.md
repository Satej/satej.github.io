APIs are a very integral parts of systems built especially when they help connect distributed systems. This integral importance, makes the task of api deployment more crucial.

There have been various methodologies namely DevOps, GitOps, MLOps etc. A relatively new methodology is APIOps which applies the concepts of GitOps and DevOps to API deployment. Very similar to DevOps, APIOps helps teams easily make changes and deploy them in an incremental, iterative and automative way.

A few excellent resources on this are shared below:
