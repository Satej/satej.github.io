It was a pleasure to read the current version of [Thoughtworks Technology radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/content/dam/thoughtworks/documents/radar/2024/04/tr_technology_radar_vol_30_en.pdf){:target="_blank"}. As always, they have done a great deal of justice to the content and the tools evaluated. Their reasoning, driven by their practical experience, is very well stated and can be read with the utmost satisfaction. The current version has lots of knowledge nuggets with practical insights in data, tooling, platform, languages and specifically in LLM and AI. Please give it a read and have fun :)
