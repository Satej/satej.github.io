Below are a set of nice reads for today:

1. [Using remote systems through vscode to run podman containers](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2023/02/14/remote-container-development-vs-code-and-podman){:target="_blank"}: There are many changes in architecture from using the latest intel based desktops to deploying to a linux environment making it slower to run in systems while developing. Using remote services, yet in an easy seamless integration with vscode makes this article a nice read and tool in every engineer's toolbelt.

2. [A comparative philosophical view between ActiveMQ and Kafka](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2023/02/16/comparison-activemq-and-kafka){:target="_blank"}: The author has been very detailed and it's a fun read with the pictures to understand.
