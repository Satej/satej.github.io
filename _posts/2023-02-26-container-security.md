As more and more organizations are adopting the container platforms like kubernetes, openshift and tanzu just to mention a few, a very important factor to consider is Security given you can install any open source software in a container and deploy it. This increases the responsibility on part of the developer to think about it and also with the shifting left of security into the developer responsibility.

The question arises what are some of the state of the art tools which enable security in containerization validating the software supply chain.

Red Hat Openshift provides a comprehensive approach to help with security through its experience and ecosystem which can be referred [here](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/security){:target="_blank"}.
