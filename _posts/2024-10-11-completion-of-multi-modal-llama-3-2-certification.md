Deeplearning.ai training courses are very practical and fun to learn and practice. I recently completed [the Multi-modal Llama 3.2](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/accomplishments/2f5ecb99-c7f4-456c-a500-6343819b7839?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} course. It was very interesting to learn about the change in architecture, inclusion of vision capability and a lot of examples.
