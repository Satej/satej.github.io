Customer engagement is a crucial aspect of businesses fostering brand loyalty and strengthening customer relationships.

Some examples of current available customer engagement platforms are:

1. Social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram - Engagement with customers through content sharing, interactive campaigns, and real-time communication.

2. Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software such as Salesforce, HubSpot, and Zoho CRM - Offer comprehensive solutions for businesses to manage customer interactions, track customer data, and implement targeted engagement strategies.

3. Online community platforms like Lithium, Vanilla Forums, and Discourse - Enable businesses to build and nurture customer communities, fostering discussions, knowledge sharing, and peer-to-peer support.

One downside of these tools is protection of data which is on a third-party server / service. One tool which facilitates this is the open source customer engagement platform called [Dittofeed](https://dittofeed.com/){:target="_blank"}.
